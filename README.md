<strong>About The Game</strong>

Who doesn't like a little blast from the past? We've all been there. Waiting for your AOL to finish downloading so you can chat with your friends on AIM. To pass the time, you go into your computer games and pull up minesweeper. Here, I have created my version of that game. 

I hope you enjoy playing!
